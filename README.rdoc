== Welcome to Neography

Neography is a thin Ruby wrapper to the Neo4j Rest API, for more information:
* {Getting Started with Neo4j Server}[http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Getting_Started_with_Neo4j_Server]
* {Neo4j Rest API Reference}[http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j-server/milestone/rest.html]

If you want to the full power of Neo4j, you will want to use JRuby and the excellent Neo4j.rb gem at https://github.com/andreasronge/neo4j

=== Installation

  gem install 'neography', '0.0.14' # for version 1.4 of Neo4j

or 

  gem install 'neography', '0.0.15' # for version 1.5 of Neo4j

After that, in your ruby script:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'neography'

in order to access the functionality.


=== Dependencies

  for use:
  json
  httparty 

  for development:
  rspec 
  net-http-spy 
  fakeweb 

==== Rails

Just add gem 'neography' to your Gemfile and run bundle install

=== Documentation

  @neo = Neography::Rest.new({:protocol => 'http://', 
                              :server => 'localhost', 
                              :port => 7474, 
                              :directory => '',  # use '/<my directory>' or leave out for default 
                              :authentication => 'basic', # 'basic', 'digest' or leave out for default 
                              :username => 'your username', #leave out for default  
                              :password => 'your password',  #leave out for default 
                              :log_file => 'neography.log',
                              :log_enabled => false,
                              :max_threads => 20})

Quick initializer (assumes basic authorization if username is given):

  @neo = Neography::Rest.new("http://username:password@myserver.com:7474/mydirectory")

  # "depth" is a short-hand way of specifying a prune evaluator which prunes after a certain depth. 
  # If not specified a depth of 1 is used and if a "prune evaluator" is specified instead of a depth, no depth limit is set.

Please see the specs for more examples.

Experimental:

=== Phase 2

Trying to mimic the Neo4j.rb API.

Now we are returning full objects.  The properties of the node or relationship can be accessed directly (node.name).
The Neo4j ID is available by using node.neo_id .

  @neo2 = Neography::Rest.new ({:server => '192.168.10.1'})

  Neography::Node.create                                               # Create an empty node

  Neography::Node.create(@neo2, {"age" => 31, "name" => "Max"})        # Create a node on the server defined in @neo2
  Neography::Node.create({"age" => 31, "name" => "Max"}, @neo2)        # Same as above, but different order
